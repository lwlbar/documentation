The ini files translations are managed by [Transifex](https://www.transifex.com/joolanders/zoolanders/%1$s/) where you can get the latest versions and participate as a translator. To install language files on your site there are two ways:

## Manually

Download the translated file from Transifex and place them into `administrator/language/{LANG}` folder under the name `{LANG}.%2$s.ini`. E.g: `administrator/language/es-ES/es-ES.%2$s.ini`

>>>>> The default `en-GB.%2$s.ini` language file is located in the `administrator/language/en-GB` folder.

## Through ZOOlanders Manager

Access the **ZOOlanders Extensions Manager** and click on the **Language Packs** button to manage the available translations for all Extensions or the **Language** button on each extension row to manage them individually.
