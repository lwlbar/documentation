You have **two** ways of installing the extension, the first and easier one is the 1-click install with **ZOOlanders Extension Manager**, the second option is to download the **zip** package and install with **Joomla! Extension Manager** as like with any other plugin. Both options requires that the ZOOlanders extension is installed first.

## Option 1: with ZOOlanders Manager

1. In your site, locate the extension entry in the ZOOlanders Manager extensions list
2. Click on its Install button

## Option 2: with Joomla! Manager

1. Download the package from the [Downloads](https://www.zoolanders.com/extensions/%1$s)
2. In your site, go to Joomla! Extension Manager and use the **Upload Package File** option to upload and install the zip package

>>> If you have issues with the installation try the alternative **Install from Directory** method uploading the unzipped package content into the `/tmp` folder of your site. Then input the path and click on the Install button.

After installation make sure the extension is enabled, otherwise do so manually. Please note that Elements are held under the same **ZL Elements** plugin for performance reasons.
